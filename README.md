# Introduction to Software Installation for Biomolecular Simulations

This material is designed to assist beginners/new scientists in biomolecular simulations with configuring their workstation with some basic software packages for the upcoming CCPBioSim training week. The idea here is to get familiar with installing scientific software on your workstation and have access to some of the most commonly used tools.

1. If the workstation you are setting up runs Windows (mac and linux users skip this step), decide if you are going to work in a Linux Virtual Machine or use the Windows Subsystem for Linux.

2. Install a Molecular Visualiser (VMD)

If you wish you can also in addition to VMD, install pymol https://pymol.org/2/


3. Install AMBERTools

4. Have a go at pip installing some common tools such as mdtraj, numpy, matplotlib.

pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
pip install mdtraj
